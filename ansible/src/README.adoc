== Setup the environment to develop modules

=== General info

The Ansible modules (not the plugins) are developed in the `src`
directory, where there are a couple of things to consider:

* The Ansible modules _cannot_ be run on their own, as they lack some
included modules and other functionality
* As all modules use the same functions to connect to the API and so on,
these general functions are placed in the file `include.py` This is to
ensure all modules contain the same generic code, without editing a lot
of files with every change to the API-call or some other generic
function
* The script `doit` combines every `mm_*.py` file with the `header`,
`imports` and `include.py` to a runnable module in the `library`
directory. After _every_ edit of a module-file (`mm_*.py`) the `doit`
script needs to be run
* To ensure you don’t forget to run the `doit` script, a script called
`trigger` is available and this runs the `doit` when a file in the `src`
directory changes. This does need `inotify` to be installed
* I would have loved to use Ansible to use _documentation fragments_ as
some parts of the documentation are valid for all modules, but as the
configuration for these fragments changed from 2.7 to 2.9, I skipped
this.

=== Software

To develop a module some extra software is needed, e.g. Python and the
Ansible development tree.

Install Python2 and Python3, this depends on your operating system. If
you cannot find a suitable Python version for your OS, have a look at:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

=== Create a set of virtual environments

Note, this requires the _virtualenv_ package:

....
pip install virtualenv
....

Then:

....
mkdir ~/venv
cd ~/venv
virtualenv -p python2 python2
virtualenv -p python3 python3
....

=== Get the Ansible sources

....
cd ~/venv
git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
....

This gives you the Ansible Development repository with the `devel`
branch as the default. Currently this is the Ansible 2.10 development
branch. As the complete development setup for Ansible is under heavy
revision in version 2.10 (the push forward to Ansible Collections) not
all needed modules and other bits and pieces are in the 2.10 branch. In
the development tree a branch from version 2.9 is needed.

So, issue the commands:

....
cd ansible
git checkout origin/stable-2.9
....

After this it is needed to make sure all requirements for Ansible are
installed as well:

....
. ~/python2/venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
. ~/python3/venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
....

When you start coding, first ensure your environment is setup correctly:

....
source ~/venv/python3/bin/activate && source ~/venv/ansible/hacking/env-setup
....

=== Setup a develop and test environment

To quickly setup a develop and test environment, a simple script
is available.

[source,bash]
----
#/bin/bash

# Setup the test and development environment
# The directory ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible
# contains a complete Ansible development tree
# for version 2.9 (as that is the current stable
# version)

virtualenv -p python2 p2_ans27
virtualenv -p python2 p2_ans28
virtualenv -p python2 p2_ans29

virtualenv -p python3 p3_ans27
virtualenv -p python3 p3_ans28
virtualenv -p python3 p3_ans29

(. p2_ans27/bin/activate
pip install requests ansible==2.7.17
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/requirements.txt
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/docs/docsite/requirements.txt
)

(. p2_ans28/bin/activate
pip install requests ansible==2.8.11
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/requirements.txt
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/docs/docsite/requirements.txt
)

(. p2_ans29/bin/activate
pip install requests ansible==2.9.7
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/requirements.txt
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/docs/docsite/requirements.txt
)

(. p3_ans27/bin/activate
pip install requests ansible==2.7.17
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/requirements.txt
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/docs/docsite/requirements.txt
)

(. p3_ans28/bin/activate
pip install requests ansible==2.8.11
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/requirements.txt
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/docs/docsite/requirements.txt
)

(. p3_ans29/bin/activate
pip install requests ansible==2.9.7
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/requirements.txt
pip install -r ~/develop/virtualenv/ansible/docs/docsite/requirements.txt
)
----

=== Running the module in terminal mode

As the Men&Mice modules do not target Ansible nodes, it is possible to
test the modules from the development machine with:

....
python -m ansible.modules.mandm.mm_zone ~/venv/src/json/ansi_zone.json
....

With an Ansible JSON file that contains all the module parameters,
looking like:

....
{ "ANSIBLE_MODULE_ARGS": {
    "state": "present",
    "name": "testzone",
    "nameserver": "mmsuite.example.net",
     masters": "172.16.17.2",
    "dynamic": true,
    "servtype": "Master",
    "authority": "dns1.example.net",
    "customproperties": {
      "owner": "Ton Kersten",
      "place": "Groesbeek"
    },
    "provider" : {
        "mmurl": "http://mmsuite.example.net",
        "user": "apiuser",
        "password": "apipasswd"
    }
  }
}
....

=== Tested environments

All modules and plugins have been tested on CentOS7, CentOS8 and Ubuntu
18.04 with Ansible 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9, all using Python2 and Python3.

Caveat: As the operating systems do not have all these combinations of
Ansible and Python available, the tests where done in Python virtual
environments.

=== Linting

All modules and plugins have been checked with `pycodestyle` and
`flake8` to ensure valid code that adheres to the Python style-guide.

To install `pycodestyle` run

....
pip3 install pycodestyle
....

And create a configuration file in `~/.config/pycodestyle`, containing

....
[pycodestyle]
count = False
max-line-length = 160
statistics = True
....

The configuration for `flake8` goes into `~/.config/flake8` and contains

....
[flake8]
exclude = .venv*,@*,.git
max-line-length = 160
....

The only override on the PEP8 standard is the maximum line-length.

A third check is done with `pylint`, but (as expected) this needs to be
tweaked a little. The `pylint` command nags about a couple of things,
that need to be taken into account:

* The default maximum line-length of 80. This needs to be overridden
`max-line-length=160`
* Ansible requires a `__metaclass__ = type` line at the top of the
module, but the `__metaclass__` name is not a valid classname, so
override with `class-rgx=[A-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9]+$|__metaclass__`
* During development not the complete Ansible environment is available
(at least not for linting), so _pylint_ is _not_ able to find the
`ansible.module_utils.six.moves.urllib.error` module. Ignore this
message in the `disable` rule
* The second issue is a direct result of the first one, as _pylint_ is
not able to import Ansibles `urllib.error`, `pylint` is not capable of
finding the `urllib` function Ignore this message in the `disable` rule
* A third issue is the `ConnectionError`. This is already available in
the standard Python environment, but for Ansible this is overruled
through the `ansible.module_utils.connection` module Ignore this message
in the `disable` rule

This results in a `disable` rule of

....
disable= W0622,E0611,E0401
....

=== Route

X] Allocate an IP address (meaning claim it/find the next free one, set
    a custom property) in an existing subnet/range
    - This is split into multiple parts
      [X] Create custom properties, for a server, zone, whatever
          `mm_props`
      [X] Find the next free IP address in a zone (lookup plugin)
          `mm_freeip`
      [X] Claim the IP address and set custom properties
          `mm_claimip`
[X] Add/modify/delete a DNS record (A/AAAA record, but also CNAME or
    PTR. The PTR is usually maintained automatically, so you don't have
    to worry about it when you add an A or AAAA record)
    `mm_dnsrecord`

    - Get IPAM on IP address
    - Get DNSRecords ref
      if found:
        - Create DNS Record
        - Get DNS Record and change
      otherwise:
        - Get DNSZoneRef
        - Create DNS record

Not that often then:
[X] Create/delete/modify a DHCP reservation in an existing scope
    `mm_dhcp`
[x] Create/delete/modify a DNS zone
    `mm_zone`
[ ] Allocate/free up a new subnet
[ ] Then the rest of the functionality.. like create a scope and so on...


== The Module Map

=== Basic (67)

[X] (62) Run API commands against Men&Mice API
    [X] (63) Generic user authentication
    [X] (64) Handle High availability
        - TonK: If I understood correctly what David said, the HA
          functionality is created by a round-robin DNS entry.
          So, when one server is down, I just wait a little and
          give it a retry. This is what I have implemented in
          the API call, at the moment. This will be tested by Carsten
    [X] (65) Handle errors reported by Men&Mice Central API

=== Generic (68)

[X] (42) Ansible plugin installer -> In documentation
[X] (43) Inline documentation for Ansible user
[ ] (44) General documentation for Ansible user
    - In progress
[X] (45) Inventory information to Ansible
[ ] (46) Ansible Playbook
    - Continuously in progress
    - Currently a test playbook per module, eventually a playbook
      that does something useful.
[ ] (47) Ansible roles for Men&Mice
    - Needs research by Carsten
[ ] (48) Support generically available Ansible version and
    support newer than 2.7
    - TonK: Support Ansible 2.[789] with Python[23]
    - TonK: Create a Molecule test set
      (lot of work, takes long, not easy, so expensive,
       currently out of scope)
