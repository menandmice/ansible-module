== Ansible Micetro development environment

See the `docs` directory for the complete documentation.

And also see the `src` directory for all sources
and the development information.

- The script `maketree` creates a `mandm_suite` directory
  which contains the distribution files.
  This directory can be shared with everyone who wants
  to use Ansible with the Men&Mice Suite.


== Running modules while testing

- `ANSIBLE_KEEP_REMOTE_FILES=1 ansible-playbook play.yml`
- Then in the $TMPDIR: `AnsiballZ_module.py explode`
- In the module code add `module.log(....)` and follow the
  systems logfiles
