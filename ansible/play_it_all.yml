    # The `ipaddr` filter needs the Python `netaddr` module, so make sure

    # The `ipaddr` is used to determine the reverse IP address
    #
    # For example:
    #   vars:
    #     ipa4: "172.16.17.2"
    #     ipa6: "2001:785:beef:1:f2c4:8f9d:b554:e614"

    #
    # The reverse zones are split on '.' and only the last part is
    # used (in this example). The reverse for IPv4 assumes a '/24' network
    # and the '16' in the IPv6 zone conversion is for a '/64' network. Adapt these to your
    # own needs (e.g. '2' for a '/16' network on IPv4 or '20' for an IPv6 '/48' net.
