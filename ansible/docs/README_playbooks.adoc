== Example playbooks

To use the Men&Mice Suite Ansible Integration you need to create Ansible
playbooks that utilize the functionality of the Men&Mice Suite.

Following are a couple of example playbooks for inspiration.

These playbooks have been tested extensively with different operating
systems, versions of Ansible and Python. For a complete overview, have
a look at the "<<README_testmatrix.adoc#testmatrix,Testmatrix>>" chapter.

Caveat: As the operating systems do not have all these combinations of
Ansible and Python available, the tests where done in Python virtual
environments.

All these playbooks are available in the `examples` directory.
