Manage DNS records in Micetro

In DNS it is very common to have multiple entries with the same name, as
the example below shows.

.Multiple DNS entries for a single name

----
mail01.example.net.   7200   IN   A      192.0.2.25
mail01.example.net.   7200   IN   A      192.0.2.143
mail01.example.net.   7200   IN   AAAA   2001:db8::25
mail01.example.net.   7200   IN   AAAA   2001:db8::587

[TIP]
====
To enable multiple records with the same name in the Ansible modules,
there is no possibility to change a record, the only way is to add the new
record with the updated data and remove the old one after that.
====

==== Options

- `aging`: The aging timestamp of dynamic records in AD integrated zones.
  Hours since January 1, 1601, UTC. Providing a non-zero value creates a
  dynamic record.
- `comment`: Comment string for the record. Note that only records in
  static DNS zones can have a comment string
- `data`: (required) The data that is added to the DNS record.
  The record data is a space-separated list, when the resource type is
  one of: `MX`, `SRV`, `NAPTR`, `CAA`, `CERT`, `HINFO` or `TLSA`. +
  Example: `data: "100 10 U E2U+sip !^.*$!sip:customer-service@example.com! ."`
  For MX and SRV the hostname should be the short name and not the FQDN.
- `dnszone`: (required) The DNS zone where the action should take place.
- `enabled`: True if the record is enabled. If the record is disabled the
  value is false
- `name`: (required) The name of the DNS record. Can either be partially
  or fully qualified.
- `provider`: (required) Definition of the Micetro API provider.
- `rrtype`: Resource Record Type for this DNS record. Default is `A`.
- `state`: The state of the properties. (`absent`, `present`)
- `ttl`: The Time-To-Live of the DNS record.
